# My Personal Project: Online Examination System

## Background

This project serves as my playground to test and enhance my skills in web development. It began as a PHP-based examination system and has evolved as I've learned new technologies.

As a learning exercise and a means to challenge my programming knowledge, I aimed to create a full-featured online examination system. It's a constantly evolving project that reflects my ongoing learning and exploration of various programming languages and technologies.

## Project Structure

### `php_api`

The initial RESTful API for authentication, authorization, admin, and student routes. Built with CodeIgniter 4.x, utilizing MySQL as the database, and JWT tokens for authentication.

### `fastify_api`

To improve performance, I migrated the app to Fastify.js. This API also functions as a RESTful API but with improvements in performance and structure. Utilizes MongoDB as its database.

### `ts_socket`

Transitioned from AWS Lambda to a separate socket app using TypeScript for faster development and better error catching. This app efficiently handles the exam interface with improved error handling due to TypeScript's typing system.

### `react_app`

The user interface built with React.js, leveraging "create react app" for rapid development. Components are designed and handled except for the CSS, as I focus more on HTML and React. 

## Project Evolution

This repository is a testament to my continuous learning journey. I constantly update and modify the project, implementing new skills and technologies like Node.js, TypeScript, and improved architectures to enhance the system.

Feel free to explore the various components and their respective directories to see the evolution of this project and my growing expertise in different technologies and programming paradigms.
