# PHP API - CodeIgniter RESTful API

This directory contains the RESTful API implemented in CodeIgniter for the Online Examination System. The API handles authentication, authorization, admin, and student routes.

## Why CodeIgniter?

In choosing a PHP framework for this project, I opted for CodeIgniter due to its ease of learning and development. CodeIgniter's deployment flexibility made it a suitable choice, allowing effortless deployment to various types of web hosting services. Unlike other frameworks like Laravel or Symfony, which posed challenges when deploying to shared hosting environments, CodeIgniter proved to be simple, secure, and adaptable.

### Key Features

- **Ease of Deployment**: Simple deployment to a wide range of web hosting services.
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable framework suitable for different hosting environments.
- **Speed**: CodeIgniter's performance and speed outshine other available PHP frameworks.
- **Security**: Provides robust security features without compromising on simplicity.

## Unfinished Sections and Discontinuation

Please note that this RESTful API was discontinued as I shifted to other frameworks like Express/Fastify in Node.js for further development of the project. Consequently, some sections, such as the payment and credit system, may remain incomplete.

### Unfinished Components

- **Credit System**: Implemented to restrict user access, requiring admins to have credits to conduct exams.
- **Payment System**: Designed to allow admins to purchase credits for exam conduction.
  
As the development on this RESTful API has been discontinued, the credit and payment systems may not be fully functional and could potentially generate errors.
