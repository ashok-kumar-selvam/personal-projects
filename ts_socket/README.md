# TypeScript Socket Module - Exam Handling

The `ts_socket` module plays a critical role in the Online Examination System, serving as the core for managing actual exams for students. Unlike the RESTful API handling admin actions and student dashboards, this module specifically manages the exam interface where students receive questions and submit their answers.

## Functionality

### Real-Time Interaction

This module utilizes WebSocket (specifically, Socket.IO) to facilitate rapid and frequent data exchange between the backend and frontend during exams. It stores students' answers and seamlessly redirects them to the dashboard once the exam concludes.

### TypeScript Implementation

The decision to implement this module in TypeScript reflects my recent acquisition of this skill. TypeScript significantly expedites the development process and aids in identifying errors during the development phase, reducing debugging time.

## Ongoing Development

This section is the focal point of ongoing development for the project. As it involves the core functionality of managing exams and interactions between students and the system, it's subject to frequent updates and improvements.

### Evolution with TypeScript

The inclusion of TypeScript has been beneficial in streamlining the development process and enhancing code reliability. However, please note that this section might undergo frequent changes as I continue to evolve and improve its functionalities.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its enhancement as this section remains an integral part of the Online Examination System, pivotal in providing a seamless exam-taking experience for students.
